# Title: Operating System Project
The team members in this project are Joseph Rodriguez and Alexander Ayala. This multi-part semester long project
will see us implement a simplified operating system using C++. The first part of the project revolves around
setting up a basic authentification system, which will serve as the foundation of the operating system. Eventually, we will
have to create more complex components of the operating system, including an interactive graphical user interface.
